## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)  
  I used **React.js** to build the website's user interface, enabling dynamic rendering and smooth navigation across pages. React's component-based architecture made it easy to organize and manage the website's different sections.

- **Deployment:**  
  ![Netlify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netlify-00C7B7?style=for-the-badge&logo=netlify&logoColor=white)  
  The website is hosted on **Netlify**, providing continuous deployment from this GitHub repository and ensuring fast load times.

- **Styling:**  
  ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)  
  Custom styles were implemented using **CSS3**, focusing on a clean, modern look with a light and dark theme toggle.

- **Version Control:**  
  ![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)  
  This project uses **Git** for version control, and all code is tracked and managed through GitHub.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Single Page Application (SPA):** Built as an SPA with React, the site offers a fast and seamless browsing experience.
- **Customizable Theme:** A light and dark theme switcher was implemented to enhance user comfort.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
- **Optimized Performance:** Lazy loading and code splitting were used to improve page load times and performance.
  
## üöß Development Process

The development of this portfolio was an iterative process:

1. **Design Phase:**  
   I started with a rough design on Figma, focusing on a minimal yet functional layout that would highlight my work effectively.

2. **React Integration:**  
   I split the website into reusable React components for the header, projects section, skills display, and contact form. This modularity ensured easy maintenance and scalability.

3. **State Management:**  
   React's state management was used for controlling the theme switcher and navigation features. For the theme switcher, I stored the user's preference in `localStorage` to persist between sessions.

4. **Deployment & Continuous Integration:**  
   Netlify handles automatic deployment whenever I push new updates to this repository, ensuring the live site is always up to date.
